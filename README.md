# Freeverse API Examples
This repository provides examples of how to use the public Freeverse packages created for NodeJS.

## Setup

Navigate to nodejs folder.

```
npm ci
```

## Usage

All examples are short, self-explanatory scripts. Most scripts include examples about how to use them.

For example, to create and asset, just check the code ```nodejs/asset_create.js```. To learn how to create an asset, just run 
```
cd nodejs && node asset_create.js
```
This will return the description of the script input parameters, an example of how to use it.
